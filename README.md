# Kesha Kravchenko

Web developer crafting modern and scalable web applications.

Kharkiv, Ukraine.

I love working on web systems that are not only functional,
but also clean, understandable, and pleasant to work with.
Care, structure, and attention to detail matter to me.

Building things that last ✨
