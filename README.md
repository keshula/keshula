### About

I’m a **web developer** focused on building systems that feel calm, structured, and reliable.

My work is centered around **web applications and web infrastructure** — from writing clear frontend logic to configuring servers and deployment pipelines. I care about how projects grow over time, how easy they are to maintain, and how comfortable they are for other developers to work with.

Clean structure, attention to detail, and clarity in decisions are essential parts of my process.  
I enjoy turning complex requirements into simple, understandable web solutions.

📍 Kharkiv, Ukraine 🇺🇦
